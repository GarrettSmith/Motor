MOTOR ENGINE: SUPER DUPER ALPHA!
March 7, 2011

OVERVIEW
Component based entities created at runtime through the parsing of xml files means 
no compiling for minor alterations and the easy reuse of written components.

Completely written in jave making it 100% compatible on anything that can run java 
(That means everything!)

Powerful and configurable threading system allows independent logic updates, rendering, 
and sound playback.

Completely abstracted input events allow the mapping of mouse, keyboard and even joystick 
input into easily useable Game Input.

Rule objects act similarly to entity components  to encourage reuse, and simple 
configuration.

SYSTEM PREREQUISITES
